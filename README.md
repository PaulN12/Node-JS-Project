# Node-JS-Project

This was a Node JS Project; it is my first Node JS Project that I did, following a tutorial from Transversy Media on Youtube. As I improve on Node JS, and learning other backend technologies, it servses as a foundation for me to improve as I expand my knwoeldge and skill of Node JS.
